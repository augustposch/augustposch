### August Posch

I'm a data scientist focused on improving public transit. I love understanding the world through data, and using that understanding to help people! I currently work as a researcher in the Ganguly SDS Lab at Northeastern University.

Currently working on:
- in-season crop mapping, using satellite data and machine learning, in order to predict yields and manage extreme weather;
- transit system resilience, to predict and deter threats, and to recover functionality optimally if hazards do occur;
- transit ridership prediction, in order to reduce crowding and encourage more people to choose transit over cars.
